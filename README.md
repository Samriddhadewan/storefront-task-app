# Next.js Storefront - A Task

This project was built as the final task assigned by DevPoojit Sir during the last round of hiring.

It is a small, responsive storefront built with **Next.js** that fetches product data from the [DummyJSON Products API](https://dummyjson.com/products).

## Features

- Browse a list of products with images, names, and prices  
- View detailed product information on a separate page  
- Add products to a shopping cart  
- Cart contents persist in the browser using localStorage, so they remain after page refresh  
- Clean code with a structured commit history  
- Deployed live on [Vercel](https://storefront-task-app.vercel.app/) for easy access

## Use of AI in This Project

During the development of this storefront, I leveraged AI tools to:

- **Generate project structure and boilerplate code** for faster setup.  
- **ProductCard** component was initially generated with the help of AI tools. After that, I customized and refined the code to fit the specific design and functionality requirements of this project.
- The **Product Detail Page** component was also created with AI assistance to scaffold the basic structure. I then enhanced it by implementing detailed product information display, handling dynamic routing, and integrating it with the cart functionality to allow adding items directly from this page.  
- The **localStorage functionality** for persisting the cart was initially generated with AI assistance. I adapted and enhanced the code to efficiently save, retrieve, and update cart data in the browser, ensuring the cart state persists across page reloads and browser sessions.
  
- **Help draft commit messages and documentation**, including this README.  

AI served as a helpful assistant throughout the project to improve productivity and code quality.
